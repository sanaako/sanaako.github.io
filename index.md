## Favorite CSPC 120L Labs

Lab 6, Part 2: 
	Lab 6, part 2 is my favorite lab since it’s a game I’ve played with my friends and family. When I was doing this lab, we were still learning about different ways we can use if statements, so it was cool seeing the different capabilities. Regarding the bonus points, I originally had a different way of going about it, but once I thought about the concept of bonus points, it proved to be much easier.
 
Lab 7, Part 2: 
	 Lab 7, part 2 proved to be much more fun than I had originally expected. At first, I thought it would be annoying having to think about all the options but it was the opposite. Keeping in mind the multiple different conditions and putting it into statements showed a different way of thinking.
  
Lab 9, Part 2: 
	Although Lab 9, part 2 wasn’t my number one favorite, it was nice seeing how we were able to compare two strings. Before this, I only knew how to compare two strings entirely rather than look for a specific character. Learning about this made me think about how it can be used for other things such as websites, etc.
